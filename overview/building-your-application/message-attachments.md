```python
Sending a message with attachment response to an API URL call


import json
from yellowant.messageformat import MessageClass, MessageAttachmentsClass, MessageButtonsClass

#Receiving command request from the user in a Django view
def api_url(request):    
      data = json.loads(request.POST["data"])
      args = data["args"]
      service_application = data["application"]
      verification_token = data['verification_token']
      function_id = data['function']
      function_name = data['function_name']

      if verification_token == settings.verification_token:
        # Processing command in some class Command and sending a Message Object
        message = MessageClass()
        message.message_text = "I have received your command!"

        message.attach(attachment_2)


        # Returning message response
        return HttpResponse(message.to_json())
        # Alternatively, you can send a simple JSON response like
        # return HttpResponse(json.dumps({"message_text":"I have received your command!", "attachments":[{"title":"This is first Attachment Title", "title_link":"https://http://www.github.com/lord/slate/", "text": "This is an attachment text"},{"title":"This is second Attachment Title", "text": "This is the attachment text for the second attachment"}]}))

        error_message = {"message_text":"Incorrect Verification token"}
        return HttpResponse(json.dumps(error_message), content_type="application/json")
```

### Attachment Fields

Messages can also contain attachments - which are formatted as a list view within the main message. All fields are optional. Attachments contain the following fields:

| Field\(All optional\) | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| title | The Title of the Field |
| value | The value of the Field |
| short | 0 if each field must occupy a row, 1 - if multiple fields can be displayed per row |

```text
tasks = [{
  "title":"Bundle middleman error fix",
  "body": "Getting this error when running bundle exec middleman server",
  "status":"open",
  "project":"PBL-1",
  "initiator":{
    "name":"Boo-Boo Bear",
    "id":"463",
    "url":"https://www.bitbucket.org/booboo/",
    "image_url":"https://www.jellystone.com/park/bears/booboo.jpg"
  },
  "priority":"high"
},{
  "title":"Dev Branch: Links to anchor tags load H1 rather than target link",
  "body": "I recently added static TOC/navigation to my flavor of slate and now, when an H2/H3/H4 link is loaded, it loads to the H1 anchor rather than the appropriate anchor linked.",
  "status":"open",
  "project":"PBL-1",
  "initiator":{
    "name":"Yogi Bear",
    "id":"461",
    "url":"https://www.bitbucket.org/yogi/",
    "image_url":"https://www.jellystone.com/park/bears/yogi.jpg"
  },
  "priority":"low"
}
]


message = MessageClass()
message.title = "Open JIRA tickets"
message.message_text = "Following are the open JIRA tickets for project PBL-1"

for task in tasks:
    attachment = MessageAttachmentsClass()
    attachment.title = task['title']
    attachment.author_name = task['initiator']['name']
    attachment.author_link = task['initiator']['url']
    attachment.author_icon = task['initiator']['image_url']

    field_status = AttachmentFieldsClass()
    field_status.title = "Status"
    field_status.value = task['status']
    attachment.attach_field(field_status)

    field_priority = AttachmentFieldsClass()
    field_priority.title = "Status"
    field_priority.value = task['status']
    attachment.attach_field(field_priority)

    message.attach(attachment)

    return message.to_json()
```

## Attachment Buttons {#attachment-buttons}

Message attachments can also contain interactive buttons - which are defined as an array, and displayed in a row at the bottom of the attachment area

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| text | The text displayed opn the button |
| value | The value associated with the button |
| name | A value that helps you categorize each button into groups |
| **command** | The command object in JSON format |

### Attachment Button Commands {#attachment-button-commands}

YellowAnt enables you to encode a command of your application or another third party user application\(if the user has authorized you to encode the third party applicationâ€™s commands in your application\) inside a button. This command will point to one of your declared functions with arguments to supply to the function. When the user clicks on the button, YellowAnt will send the command object to your API URL\(or to the third party application\) and you can handle it in the same way you handle a regular command. You can also ask the user for input values for the command, which will be rendered as input boxes in a Dialog

The Command Object has the following format:

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| service\_application | The user integration id of the application you want the button to call |
| function\_name | The name of the function |
| data | A JSON representation of the function arguments. For example:`{"repo_id":"skywalker", "issue_id":"469"}` |
| inputs | A list of arguments to ask the user as inputs within a Dialog. For example, if you want to show a dialog to get inputs for sending a mail, the inputs value will be:`["to","body", "subject"]` |
